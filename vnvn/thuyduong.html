<p>Born in Dalat, Thuy Duong's real name is Nguyen Thuy Duong. She loved to sing as a little girl and with the training and encouragement from her brother, she got her first gig as a professional singer in Saigon in 1987.</p>
<p>Emigrated to the United States in 1992, she signed a contract with Asia Productions and their collaboration gave birth to 3 hot selling CDs, Thuy Duong 1, 2 and 3. Love ballads such as Mot Mai Em Di, Khuc Thuy Du, Yeu ... 
  became her signature songs as her unique rendition propelled these old songs to top hits status. After 3 CDs and numerous music video appearances with Asia, Thuy Duong made a retreat from the limelight to start a family.</p>
<p>She reappeared in 1997 and soon after formed her own production, TD Music, in Southern California where she currently resides. The first release, Chut Tinh Xa Vang, received wide acclaim from fans. Her latest solo CD is Dong Thoi Gian, 
to commemorate 60 years of Vietnamese modern music.</p>
